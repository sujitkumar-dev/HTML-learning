# HTML Learning Repository 🌐

Welcome to my **HTML Learning Repository**! This is where I’m documenting my journey of learning and practicing HTML — the foundational language of the web.

This repo is organized into folders based on major HTML topics and includes basic examples, small projects, and hands-on practice files. Each folder contains code samples that demonstrate core HTML concepts in a clear and easy-to-follow way.
